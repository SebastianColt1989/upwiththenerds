        <p>God Dam, this phone is so confusing. On one hand it's a media champ, great sound, stunning crisp visual, battery life that goes for hours. On the other hand, it's battery drains to zero overnight, even when it's not being used. This phone is like me, frustrating because it can be amazing, let's delve into it.</p>
        <p>The good stuff, I am a fan of material design, I love basic, raw functionality. Which is why I purchased the Pixel 2, its sleak, sutle desgin language, mixed with stock android is my idea of paradise. I love android in its purist form before it becomes corrupted with horrible skin, Samsung, here's looking at you. The best part of the phone for me is the camera, the image and video quality is best on the market. 4K, low light, porttrait mode. It doesn't matter, the phone is a champ and smashes the competition.</p>

        <p> The bad is the weirdly inconsitant battey life. I understand that it's an older phone, it's not the biggest device and you should not expect 2 days of battery life. With all that I'm still frustrated with the battery. I've used the device to watch endless Youtube videos and the battery just keeps on chugging. Even when it gets to below 10%, it still goes for ages. Which is great, so imagine my confusion, when putting it on my bedside table for an evening, bluetooth off, mobile hotspot on, I awake the next morning to find the battery completely drain. I thought this may have been a one off or I had somehow left the display on all night. So I tried again the next evening and the next for the same result. I don't understand why or how this happens given the frugal battery consumption. </p>
